# Website-Security-Breach-OS-Hardening-Practice

## Objective

The purpose of this project was to investigate a website security breach and recommend measures to mitigate future attacks. The focus was on analyzing network traffic using tools like tcpdump, identifying compromised protocols, and documenting the incident to enhance understanding of cybersecurity best practices.


### Skills Learned

- Understanding and analyzing network traffic logs.
- Recognizing and responding to practice brute-force attacks and malicious code injections.

### Tools Used

- tcpdump: For capturing and analyzing network traffic logs.
- Wireshark: For deeper packet analysis and protocol dissection.
